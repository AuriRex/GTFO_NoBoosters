# GTFO_NoBoosters

A GTFO mod that removes boosters from the game entirely by completely stopping the game from requesting your booster inventory.  
(Includes moving the Apparel button up as well ^-^)

If you don't want people to simply toggle boosters back on in r2mm, feel free to copy this mod dll into your rundowns package instead :p  

### **WARNING: This also stops your vanity items from loading, use [AllVanity](https://thunderstore.io/c/gtfo/p/AuriRex/AllVanity/) in addition**

## Incompatible with 'DeviousLick'!!
